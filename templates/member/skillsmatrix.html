                The <strong>Woodkirk Skills Framework</strong> is about introducing a set of core skills that we feel
                will develop our
                players into
                better footballers, and better teammates.
                </br></br>
                The framework is built on the foundations of the FA four corner model.
                </br></br>The FA's four corner model is described as... "Our aim is to develop future England players
                with
                outstanding characteristics across The FA four corner player development model"
                </br></br>In simple terms there are 4 corners each developing a set of desired competencies, whilst it
                is unlikely we will be moulding the future stars of Wembley stadium the core principles within Woodkirk
                Valley remain the same.</br> </br>
